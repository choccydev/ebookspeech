# EbookSpeech

Yet Another quick implementation of Openai STT.

This is an app i amde for myself to generate small audiobooks from ebooks or small texts. I wanted to listen to some classics while i do my dishes and this was a perfect quick tool to whip up for the occassion.

This was made for myself so like no install instructions no nothing forget about it. It's done in python with poetry, nothing fancy.
